# M4 Battery Life

This is a really short post, but I just can't get over it. My M4 MacBook Pro runs at about 6 W most of hte time,
around 45 degrees C, and regularly estimates 16-19 hours of battery life during normal, every-day use WITHOUT even turning on low power mode. I am lucky to get 3 hours of battery life at 70 degrees using my Intel MacBook Pro which is not even half as fast as this M4.

My mind is blown. I cannot fathom a computer this fast, running this cool, and regularly getting 16+ hours of battery life
