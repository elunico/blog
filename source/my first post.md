# My First Post ðŸ˜ƒ

## Contents

This is my first post on what I am calling my "blog". This blog is a little different than most
people's blogsâ€”at least when they intend to start a blog for blogging. I am starting this blog
not because I have a lot to say nor because I was sponsored by SquareSpace, but rather because
I wanted to try building a Markdown to HTML build system for a website. I intend to publish to this
blog as if it were my real blog, but I will be doing everything through my own work. All blog
entries will start like as Markdown files and will be translated. Metadata will be parsed and
(eventually) searchable (currently clicking a tag brings you a 404), and the index will be rendered
from the list of entries during the build process.

## Why am I rolling my own blog?
It sounded fun. I thought it would be interesting to put together a system like this

## Why don't I just use a well-established hosting platform?
I don't really have the time to commit to maintaing a blog and paying for a professional service for something
I don't think I can commit to regularly seems silly. Plus writing my own is way more fun so I get to have a blog and a fun project.

## What about logging in, how you will draft new posts?
If I wanted to add authentication I would **not** choose to do that myself, but since I am the only contributor to this
blog and I am doing it mostly for fun on the side, I will simply manage entries locally on my computer. I have no
need for authentication on my own personal blog, so why bother.

## Can other people use this build system?
My blog is hosted on Github pages (for now) and the repository is (by necessity) public, however
I extremely do not recommend using it sinceâ€”as mentioned previouslyâ€”this is mostly a thing I am doing for fun
and not to be the next WordPress. If you want a blog, just use WordPress; if you want to have fun, try
rolling your own, but I wouldn't recommend using mine.

## What will you write about?
The build process probably. Mac OS X, OS X, and macOS stuff. Programming and technology in general. Probably a little
about fonts and typography also.
